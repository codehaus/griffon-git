Starting with Griffon 0.9.2 there's also the possibility to define an specific thread execution policy for methods and properties via annotations

{note}
This feature is only available for Groovy code at the moment as it relies on the AST Transformation framework.
{note}

You must annotate a method or property with @[\@griffon.util.Threading|api:griffon.util.Threading]@ and define a value of type @[griffon.util.Threading.Policy|api:griffon.util.Threading.Policy]@ (though the annotation uses @Threading.Policy.OUTSIDE_UITHREAD@ by default). Annotated methods and properties must conform to these rules
 * must be public.
 * name does not match an event handler.
 * must pass @GriffonClassUtils.isPlainMethod()@ if it's a method.
 * its value must be a closure (including curried method pointers) if it's a property.

Here's a trivial example

{code}
package sample

import griffon.util.Threading

class Sample {
    @Threading
    def doStuff() {
        // executed outside of the UI thread
    }

    @Threading(Threading.Policy.INSIDE_UITHREAD_SYNC)
    def moreStuff() {
        // executed synchronously inside the UI thread
    }
}
{code}

It is worth noting that a @\@Threading@ annotation applied to a Controller's action/method will take precedence, this means you can force an specific threading policy on a Controller action other than the default one.

{code}
package sample

class SampleController {
    @Threading(Threading.Policy.INSIDE_UITHREAD_ASYNC)
    def popupDialog = {
        // build and show the dialog
    }

    def equivalentPopupDialog = {
        execAsync {
            // build and show the dialog
        }
    }
}
{code}
